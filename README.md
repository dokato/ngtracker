NG eyetracker
=========

Simple eyetracking project written as extension to some university task. It bases on [Eyetracker-NG](http://eyetracker-ng.org/) python 2.7 module originating from OpenCV. To run it you need also numpy, cv2, PIL, pygame, but the most important is special eyetracking device made from low-cost infrared webcam - [like this](http://rmantiuk.strony.wi.ps.pl/projects/diy/). 

The app allows you to trace your eye movements on the screen when looking at the one or set of pictures. You may also save resulting pictures to firgure out focus points.
